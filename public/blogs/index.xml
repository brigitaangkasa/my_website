      <description>GDP components over time and among countries For this analysis, we want to study the GDP components over time and among countriees.
At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the Wikipedia GDP page.</description>

      <description>Climate change and temperature anomalies We want to study climate change and gratefully find data on the Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here.
To define temperature anomalies, we need to have a reference, or base period, which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.</description>

nyse &amp;lt;- read_csv(here::here(&amp;quot;data&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;nyse.csv&amp;quot;)) Now that we have this data, let’s have a quick look at the number of companies per sector.</description>
