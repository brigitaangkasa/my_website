# Returns of financial stocks

As we have to pay rather high tuition fees, our idea is to make some money with stocks. We want to download some data for interesting companies that are listed at the NYSE and examine risks and returns!
But in order to download the financial data, we first have to consider the mapping of company names to stock symbols. 


```{r load_nyse_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nyse <- read_csv(here::here("data","nyse.csv"))
```


Now that we have this data, let's have a quick look at the number of companies per sector.


```{r companies_per_sector}

companies_by_sector <- nyse %>%
  group_by(sector) %>%
  count() %>% # count the number of companies by sector
  arrange(desc(n))

companies_by_sector %>% 
  rename(`number of companies` = n) %>% # rename for better reading
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")) # have a nice HTML table


ggplot(companies_by_sector, aes(x = n, y = reorder(sector, n)))+
  geom_col() + 
  labs(title = "Number of NYSE companies per sector",
       x = "number of companies",
       y = "sector")

```

Next, let's choose some stocks and their ticker symbols and download some data. Note that `SPY` is the SP500 ETF (Exchange Traded Fund).


```{r get_price_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

myStocks <- c("AXP","BLK","KO","FDX","MCD","ORCL","SPY" ) %>%
  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
         from = "2011-01-01",
         to   = "2020-08-31") %>%
  group_by(symbol) 

glimpse(myStocks) # examine the structure of the resulting data frame

```

Financial performance analysis depends on returns. Hence, we first want to calculate daily and monthly returns (given the adjusted closing prices). 


```{r calculate_returns, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
#calculate daily returns
myStocks_returns_daily <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "daily", 
               type       = "log",
               col_rename = "daily_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))  

#calculate monthly  returns
myStocks_returns_monthly <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "monthly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col)) 

#calculate yearly returns
myStocks_returns_annual <- myStocks %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "yearly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "yearly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))
```


To get a feeling for the numbers, let's summarise monthly returns for each of the stocks and the `SPY` ETF:

```{r summarise_monthly_returns}

myStocks_returns_monthly_summary <- myStocks_returns_monthly %>% 
  group_by(symbol) %>% 
  summarise(min = min(monthly_returns), 
            median = median(monthly_returns), 
            max = max(monthly_returns), 
            mean = mean(monthly_returns), 
            sd = sd(monthly_returns)) # calculate summary statistics for monthly returns by stock

myStocks_returns_monthly_summary %>% 
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")) # have a nice HTML table

```

To get an even better feeling, let's also visualise the distribution of monthly returns for each of the stocks:

```{r density_monthly_returns}

myStocks_returns_monthly %>% 
  filter(symbol != "SPY") %>% # only display density of the stocks (not the ETF)
  ggplot(aes(x = monthly_returns, fill = symbol)) + # add some color (fill) just for fun
  geom_density() + 
  facet_wrap(~symbol) + # create a density plot for each stock
  labs(title = "Distribution of monthly returns per stock", 
       x = "monthly returns") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") # show no legend

```
We can see that deviation from 0.0 is strongest for Blackrock (BLK). Hence, the stock is highly volatile and thus the riskiest.
Opposed to this, the stock of Coca Cola (KO) is quite steady, with only small changes in monthly return. Hence, this stock
is the least risky.

However, it is not only about risk, but also about returns. Hence, let's plot the risk/return profiles of our stocks!

```{r risk_return_plot}

myStocks_returns_monthly_summary %>% 
  filter(symbol != "SPY") %>% # only display the stocks (not the ETF)
  ggplot(aes(x=sd, y = mean, label = symbol)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = symbol), size = 4) + # make points a little bigger
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE, group = 0) + # add a risk-return line
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(colour = symbol)) + # add the stock names as labels to the points
  labs(title = 'Risk/Return profile of stocks', 
       x = 'Risk (stdev of monthly returns)', 
       y ="Average monthly return") +
  theme_bw() + # use a nice theme
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + # display x values as percentages
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + # display y values as percentages
  theme(legend.position = "none") # show no legend

```

As a thumb of rule, taking a higher risk is rewarded with a higher average monthly return. 
We can see that even though FedEx (FDX) has the highest risk, it does not have the highest average monthly return.
Furthermore, Blackrock (BLK) has the highest average monthly return, with only a little more risk than American Express (AXP) and Oracle (ORCL).
Regarding our goal of making money with stocks, we would thus choose a combination of Blackrock and the lower risk McDonald's (MCD), as they are above our risk-return line.
