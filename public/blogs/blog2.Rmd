# Climate change and temperature anomalies 

We want to study climate change and gratefully find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt).

To define temperature anomalies, we need to have a reference, or base period, which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Let's load the data and have a look!

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, # start in row 2
           na = "***") # recognize *** as NAs

```

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Furthermore, the dataframe is in wide format. Hence, we first bring it into long format, which makes it easier to analyse the data:

```{r tidyweather}

# bring data in tidy format
tidyweather <- weather %>%
  # only use year and month columns
  select(Year:Dec) %>%
  # bring into long format
  pivot_longer(cols = Jan:Dec, names_to = "Month", values_to = "delta") 

# print 10 rows of the table to have a look at the transformed data
tidyweather %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  kbl	() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))

```

```{r glimpse_tidyweather}

glimpse(tidyweather)

```

Note that `Year` and `Month` are stored as `double` and `character` variables (and not as `date` variables).
