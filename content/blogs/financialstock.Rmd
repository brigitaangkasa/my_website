# Returns of financial stocks

As we have to pay rather high tuition fees, our idea is to make some money with stocks. We want to download some data for interesting companies that are listed at the NYSE and examine risks and returns!
But in order to download the financial data, we first have to consider the mapping of company names to stock symbols. 


```{r load_nyse_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#load data on stocks on nyse using read_csv
nyse <- read_csv(here::here("data","nyse.csv"))
```

Now that we have this data, let's have a quick look at the number of companies per sector.

```{r companies_per_sector}

# pipe nyse data into newly defined companies_by_sector data frame
companies_by_sector <- nyse %>%
  
  #group companies by sector
  group_by(sector) %>%
  
  # count the number of companies by sector
  count() %>% 
  # arrange sectors in descending order in terms of number of companies in each sector 
  arrange(desc(n))

companies_by_sector %>% 
  # rename for better reading
  rename(`number of companies` = n) %>% 
  
  # create nice html table
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")) # have a nice HTML table

# create bar chart showing number of companies per sector
ggplot(companies_by_sector, aes(x = n, y = reorder(sector, n)))+
  geom_col() + 
  labs(title = "Number of NYSE companies per sector",
       x = "number of companies",
       y = "sector")

```

Next, let's choose some stocks and their ticker symbols and download some data. Note that `SPY` is the SP500 ETF (Exchange Traded Fund).

```{r get_price_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

# filter for 6 stocks and 1 ETF of interest
myStocks <- c("AXP","BLK","KO","FDX","MCD","ORCL","SPY" ) %>%
  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
         from = "2011-01-01",
         to   = "2020-08-31") %>%
  
  # group data by stock symbols
  group_by(symbol) 

# examine the structure of the resulting data frame
glimpse(myStocks) 

```

Financial performance analysis depends on returns. Hence, we first want to calculate daily and monthly returns (given the adjusted closing prices). 


```{r calculate_returns, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
#calculate daily returns
myStocks_returns_daily <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "daily", 
               type       = "log",
               col_rename = "daily_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))  

#calculate monthly  returns
myStocks_returns_monthly <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "monthly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col)) 

#calculate yearly returns
myStocks_returns_annual <- myStocks %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "yearly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "yearly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))
```


To get a feeling for the numbers, let's summarise monthly returns for each of the stocks and the `SPY` ETF:

```{r summarise_monthly_returns}

myStocks_returns_monthly_summary <- myStocks_returns_monthly %>% 
  group_by(symbol) %>% 
  summarise(min = min(monthly_returns), 
            median = median(monthly_returns), 
            max = max(monthly_returns), 
            mean = mean(monthly_returns), 
            sd = sd(monthly_returns)) # calculate summary statistics for monthly returns by stock

myStocks_returns_monthly_summary %>% 
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")) # have a nice HTML table

```

To get an even better feeling, let's also visualise the distribution of monthly returns for each of the stocks:

```{r density_monthly_returns}

myStocks_returns_monthly %>% 
  filter(symbol != "SPY") %>% # only display density of the stocks (not the ETF)
  ggplot(aes(x = monthly_returns, fill = symbol)) + # add some color (fill) just for fun
  geom_density() + 
  facet_wrap(~symbol) + # create a density plot for each stock
  labs(title = "Distribution of monthly returns per stock", 
       x = "monthly returns") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") # show no legend

```
We can see that deviation from 0.0 is strongest for Blackrock (BLK). Hence, the stock is highly volatile and thus the riskiest.
Opposed to this, the stock of Coca Cola (KO) is quite steady and risk averse, with only small changes in monthly return. Hence, this stock is the least risky.

However, it is not only about risk, but also about returns. Hence, let's plot the risk/return profiles of our stocks!

```{r risk_return_plot}

myStocks_returns_monthly_summary %>% 
  
  # only display the stocks (not the ETF)
  filter(symbol != "SPY") %>% 
  
  # plot scatterplot and increase size of points
  ggplot(aes(x=sd, y = mean, label = symbol)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = symbol), size = 4) +
  
  # add the stock names as labels to the points
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(colour = symbol)) + 
  
  # add title and axis labels to graph 
  labs(title = 'Risk/Return profile of stocks', 
       x = 'Risk (stdev of monthly returns)', 
       y ="Average monthly return") +
  
  # use a nice theme
  theme_bw() + 
  
  # display x values as percentages
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + 
  
  # display y values as percentages
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + 
  
  # hide legend
  theme(legend.position = "none") 

```

As a thumb of rule, taking a higher risk is rewarded with a higher average monthly return. 
We can see that even though FedEx (FDX) has the highest risk, it does not have the highest average monthly return.
Furthermore, Blackrock (BLK) has the highest average monthly return, with only a little more risk than American Express (AXP) and Oracle (ORCL).
Regarding our goal of making money with stocks, we would thus choose a combination of Blackrock and the lower risk McDonald's (MCD), as they are above our risk-return line.

From the graph, we can see that American Express (AXP) generates a higher average monthly return on average with just a little bit more risk than Oracle (ORCL). Thus, let's investigate whether this risk is worth pursuing by looking at whether the difference in return is significant!

```{r, stock_comparison}

axp_orcl<-myStocks_returns_monthly %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
    filter(symbol %in% c("AXP",
                         "ORCL")) %>%
  
  # calculate average returns per month
  summarise(average_return=mean(monthly_returns,na.rm=TRUE), 
            
            # calculate SD
            SD = sd(monthly_returns), 
            
            # calculate count
            count = n(), 
            
            # get t-critical value with (count-1) degrees of freedom
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count - 1), 
            
            # calculate standard error
            SE =  SD/sqrt(count), 
            
            # calculate margin of error
            margin_of_error = t_critical * SE, 
            
            # calculate lower bound of CI
            lower_ci = average_return - margin_of_error, 
            
            # calculate upper bound of CI
            upper_ci = average_return + margin_of_error) %>% 
  
  # have a nice HTML table
  kbl(caption = "Confidence Intervals of Returns of AXP and ORCL") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")) 

```

From the table above, we can see that the confidence interval for AXP is [0.000,0.022] and for ORCL [-0.002,0.018], which shows that the two confidence interval overlap. From this we can infer that the difference of the average returns of the 2 stocks are not that significant, so it may not be worth the risk to invest in AXP.

The AXP and ORCL monthly return data suggests that greater risk does not necessarily indicate higher returns. As this is not what we were expecting, let's explore the relationship between risk and return further, let's plot the risk and return of all the stocks in the nyse! This way we can also increase the sample size when exploring the relationship, which will give us a more granular insight! First, let's prepare the data so that all stocks are included.

```{r, all_stocks}
# filter for all stocks
allStocks <- nyse %>%
  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
         from = "2011-01-01",
         to   = "2020-08-31") %>%
  
    group_by(symbol) 

#calculate daily returns
allStocks_returns_daily <- allStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "daily", 
               type       = "log",
               col_rename = "daily_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))  

#calculate monthly  returns
allStocks_returns_monthly <- allStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "monthly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col)) 

#calculate yearly returns
allStocks_returns_annual <- allStocks %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "yearly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "yearly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))

# calculate summary statistics for monthly returns by stock
allStocks_returns_monthly_summary <- allStocks_returns_monthly %>% 
  group_by(symbol) %>% 
  summarise(min = min(monthly_returns), 
            median = median(monthly_returns), 
            max = max(monthly_returns), 
            mean = mean(monthly_returns), 
            sd = sd(monthly_returns)) 

```

Now that we have processed the data, let's analyze it!
```{r, stocks_analysis}

# join return monthly summary table to original nyse table to get sector information 
summary_sector<-allStocks_returns_monthly_summary %>% 
  
  # join with nyse data to get sector information
  inner_join(nyse) %>%
  
  # only display the stocks (not the ETF)
  filter(symbol != "SPY") 
  
  # plot scatterplot and increase size of points
  ggplot(summary_sector,aes(x=sd, y = mean, label = symbol)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = sector), size = 1) +
  
  # add title and axis labels to graph 
  labs(title = 'Upward Trend can be seen on Risk/Return profile of NYSE stocks', 
       x = 'Risk (stdev of monthly returns)', 
       y ="Average monthly return") +
  
  # use a nice theme
  theme_bw() + 
  
  # display x values as percentages
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + 
  
  # display y values as percentages
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + 
  
  # hide legend
  theme(legend.position = "right") 

```

From the trend line we can see a positive correlation, similar to the positive correlation we saw with our sample of 6 stocks. Let's see how the risk and return relationship differs between sectors. 
```{r, stocks_analysis_sector}
  
  # plot scatterplot and increase size of points
  ggplot(summary_sector,aes(x=sd, y =mean)) +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  
  # broken down by sector
  facet_wrap(~sector) +
  
  # add title and axis labels to graph 
  labs(title = 'Risk/Return Relationship Differs Between Sectors!', 
       x = 'Risk (stdev of monthly returns)', 
       y ="Average monthly return") +
  
  # use a nice theme
  theme_bw() + 
  
  # display x values as percentages
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + 
  
  # display y values as percentages
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + 
  
  # hide legend
  theme(legend.position = "right") 

```

Generally, the higher the risk, the higher the average monthly return. However, from the faceted risk return graphs above we can see that this relationship is stronger and more apparent for some sectors than others. In the Capital Goods, Consumer Durables, and Technology sector we can see that this relationship is true. However, in the other 9 sectors, this relationship does not seem to exist; as the risk increases, the returns don't seem to increase. Let's deep dive on the the risks between each sector by creating a bar chart of sector vs. risk. 
```{r}
summary_sector %>%
  
  # group by sector
  group_by(sector) %>%
  
  # calculate average risk of each sector
  summarise(mean_risk = mean(sd)) %>%
  
  # plot bar chart showing risk in each sector
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_risk, y = reorder(sector,mean_risk))) +
  
  # display x values as percentages
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + 
  
  # plot bar chart
  geom_col() +
  
  # use a nice theme
  theme_bw() + 
  
  # add title and axis labels to graph 
  labs(y = "", 
       x = "Risk (%)",
       title = "Technology and Energy Stocks have the Highest Risks")
```
From the chart above, we can see that stocks in the Technology, Energy, and Consumer Durables (top 3) sector have the highest risk. We saw in the previous chart that there is a upward trend between risk and return for the Technology and Consumer Durables sector. Thus, it may be worth to invest in stocks in the Technology and Consumer Durables sector as we can expect higher returns with higher risks. 

However, we saw that the return remains constant for stocks of different risks. Thus, it may be not worth to invest in stocks in the higher risk Energy stocks. 

As a next step, we would choose stocks that offer the highest return with the lowest risks. In addition, we would also choose stocks from different sectors as risk is dependent on the sector of interest. I will ensure to include higher risks Technology stocks and Consumer Durables, and lower risk stocks in the other sectors. But of course, we will still need to conduct qualitative research to gain a deeper understanding of the context of the current market!
